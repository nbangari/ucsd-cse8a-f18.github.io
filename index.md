## Basics

*Lecture*  Expect class to be interactive; you'll work through problems in groups, compare multiple approaches to solutions, and answer multiple-choice questions using iClickers (see <a href="#engage">Engagement</a> below). Due to space constraints, you must attend the lecture in which you're enrolled.

*Discussion* There are two kinds of discussion section: Supplemental Instructions will facilitate study-session group summaries of class content and practice exercises; TA review sessions will often directly relate to your programming assignments.  You can attend any discussion section you like.

<h3>Materials</h3>

There is no textbook for the course. The schedule above will link to all the
reference material you need for the course.

To get credit for lectures and discussions, you must have an iClicker. You
can register it through [this google form FILL]. We use clickers and have you
work on problems in lecture because there’s quite a bit of evidence that
sitting and listening passively to lecture [probably isn’t the best way to
teach or learn
science](https://www.nature.com/news/why-we-are-teaching-science-wrong-and-how-to-make-it-right-1.17963).

[The documentation for the Java
language](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/), while not required reading,
will be linked to from some assignments and is always a useful reference
while programming.



<a name="engage"></a>
<h3 id="engage">Engagement</h3>

We highly recommend actively participating in class, attending discussion, and completing the weekly review quizzes. Regularly
engaging with the class in these ways counts towards the Engagement component of your overall score.

This score is calculated on a weekly basis (starting in Week 1).  The maximum number of points you can earn in one week is 6.
The lowest weekly participation score will be dropped when calculating your overall engagement average.

Earn engagement points by:
* __In class participation via iClickers__  In Weeks 1 through 10 (starting with the second lecture of the quarter), you will 
earn credit for attending and participating in lecture (2 points each) and discussion section (1 point). 
Clicker questions will be graded for participation only and not for correctness of the response. 
Full credit for clicker points for a given day will be 
awarded for clicking in at least 80/% of the time that day. Forgetting your clicker counts as missing a class, so please 
remember to bring it! _Do not attempt to falsify iClicker or discussion participation or review quiz submissions; this would be considered a violation of academic integrity._

* __Weekly (P)review quiz__ Online quizzes review the week's material and preview some upcoming examples each week. You can 
submit your answers to each quiz as many times as you like. The latest submission before 11pm on Sunday will count towards 
your engagement score. Each weekly review quiz will be worth 6 points.  Review quizzes will stay available even after the 
deadline; in the past, students have found working through them to be helpful when studying for exams.
_The review quiz must be completed independently and individually. You may refer to your class notes and resources linked from 
this website, 
but not other references. You may not share information about the review quiz with others, take the review quiz in someone 
else's name, or ask anyone for prior knowledge about the review quiz._


We encourage you to find your preferred method for staying engaged with the course.  There are lots of ways to earn
full credit for a week's engagement.  For example: (1) attending all lectures (for the section in which you're enrolled); or
(2) attending two lectures and two discussion sections; or (3) answering all questions on the review quiz correctly; or (4) 
attending two lectures and getting two answers correct on the review  quiz; etc.

<h3 id="pas">Programming Assignments</h3> 

Learn by doing!  Most weeks, you will be working on a programming assignment for this class.
You will feel the intense excitement of seeing your work come alive through the computer, and 
also the equally intense frustration of wading through error messages and tricky bugs.  Both of these
are at the heart of what it means to be a computer scientist.  The programming assignments are designed
to invite your creativity, problem solving skills, tenacity, and interests. When you find yourself stuck
during your work on a programming assignment, ask for help:

* Open lab hours

* Instructor and TA office hours

* Private questions to instructors on the class discussion board on Piazza


Remember to always read the programming assignment description carefully.  Some programming assignments will
be **pair-programming** assignments, where you are expected to develop the algorithm and code in close collaboration 
with a partner; others will be **individual** assignments, where you will gain confidence with your own mastery
of the material.

PA0 counts towards 2% of your overall course grade, the rest of the assignments (PA1 through PA8) each count towards 5% 
of your overall course grade.


<h3 id="exams">Exams</h3>

There will be three total exams in the course: two during the quarter (also
called “midterms”) and a final exam. The midterms will be in the evening during
the quarter. They will primarily contain content from the weeks leading up to
them. Since the programming content is cumulative, the second exam will
necessarily contain content from the first exam, as well.

Seats will be assigned for all exam sessions and announced beforehand, and you
must bring your school ID to the exam. All work on exams is to be done on your
own, and you are not allowed to use any electronics or study aids during the
exam (aside from those needed for University-approved academic accommodations).

The first two exams will each be worth 8% of your final grade. The final exam
will be worth 24% of your final grade. The final exam will have a specific
structure – it will be broken into three parts corresponding to material from
the first exam, the second exam, and the remainder of the course. Your grade
for each midterm will be the *maximum* of the midterm grade and the score you
get on the corresponding part of the final exam.

For example, if you get 50% of the points for midterm 1 and 100% of the points
for midterm 2, and then score a 75% on part 1 of the final, 25% on part 2, and
100% on part 3, you would get:

- MAX(0.5, 0.75) * 8 = 6 points for midterm 1 (0.75 was higher, so the final
  increased the midterm score!)
- MAX(1, 0.25) * 8 = 8 points for midterm 2 (0.25 was lower, so the original
  midterm score was used)
- 0.75 * 8 + 0.25 * 8 + 1 * 0.8 = 16 points for the final exam (the score on
  the final exam is the same regardless of how the midterms went)
- A total of 30 out of 40 exam points towards your final grade

This policy also covers what happens if you miss a midterm for any reason. If
you are absent for a midterm, you get a 0 initially, and then whatever score
you get on the final for that section will be applied to your midterm grade.
There are no make-up midterms, and the final exam policy is governed by the
[university's
policies](https://senate.ucsd.edu/operating-procedures/educational-policies/courses/epc-policies-on-courses/policy-exams-including-midterms-final-exams-and-religious-accommodations-for-exams/).

<h3 id="lab">Labs</h3>

Along with the course, you are enrolled in a lab section, which meets each
Tuesday in one of the student labs in the (newly renovated) basement of the CSE building.
You will work in a group in lab.  We will assign the groups and group assignments may 
change from week to week: you are starting your journey into Computer Science and we want
to help you meet your classmates who will be with you along the way.  All labs must be finished
in the allotted class time.  As a group, you will create a lab report each week and your TA will review
it and give you feedback.

You must attend the lab section for which you are enrolled.

<h3 id="si">Supplemental Instruction</h3>


<a id="grading"></a>
<h3>Grading</h3>

Your grade will be computed from:

<ul>
  <li>42% programming assignments (2% for PA0, 5% for each of PA1 through PA8)</li>
  <li>40% exams (8% each for two midterms, 24% for a final exam)</li>
  <li>10% lab work (completed in lab each week)</li>
  <li>10% engagement</li>
</ul>

Yes, this adds up to 102% .

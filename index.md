## Basics

- Lecture: Due to space constraints, you must attend the lecture in which you're enrolled.  Expect class to be interactive; you'll work through problems in groups, compare multiple approaches to problem, and answer multiple-choice questions using iClickers (see <a href="#engage">Engagement</a> below).

| Lecture | Time     | Location | Instructor |
| :-----: |:--------:| :-------:| :--------: |
| A00     | MWF 10am | CENTR119 | Minnes     |
| B00     | MWF 12pm | WLH2005  | Politz     |
| C00     | MWF 9am  | CENTR119 | Minnes     |
| D00     | MWF 2pm  | WLH2005  | Politz     |

- Discussion: Discussion section will often directly relate to your programming assignments.  You can attend any discussion section you like.

| Discussion| Time     | Location | TA |

| D02       | M 7:30pm | CENTR212 | TBA     |


- Lab Sessions: You will work closely in groups to experiment with class concepts and delve deeper into the material.  You must attend the lab session in which you are enrolled.

- Exams: There will be two exams during the quarter, held in the evenings during Week 3 and Week 7 of the Fall quarter.  The Final exam is on Wednesday of exam week.

**Exam 1** Thursday 10/18/2018	8pm-9:50pm

**Exam 2** Wednesday 11/14/2018	8pm-9:50pm

**Final exam** Wednesday 12/12/2018	7pm-9:59pm

<h3>Sections</h3>

You are enrolled in a specific lecture section and a specific lab section, and
you cannot attend the lecture or lab for another section (due to space
constraints). You can attend any discussion section(s) you want.

<h3 id="exams">Exams</h3>

There will be three total exams in the course: two during the quarter (also
called “midterms”) and a final exam. The midterms will be in the evening during
the quarter. They will primarily contain content from the weeks leading up to
them. Since the programming content is cumulative, the second exam will
necessarily contain content from the first exam, as well.

Seats will be assigned for all exam sessions and announced beforehand, and you
must bring your school ID to the exam. All work on exams is to be done on your
own, and you are not allowed to use any electronics or study aids during the
exam (aside from those needed for University-approved academic accommodations).

The first two exams will each be worth 8% of your final grade. The final exam
will be worth 24% of your final grade. The final exam will have a specific
structure – it will be broken into three parts corresponding to material from
the first exam, the second exam, and the remainder of the course. Your grade
for each midterm will be the *maximum* of the midterm grade and the score you
get on the corresponding part of the final exam.

For example, if you get 50% of the points for midterm 1 and 100% of the points
for midterm 2, and then score a 75% on part 1 of the final, 25% on part 2, and
100% on part 3, you would get:

- MAX(0.5, 0.75) * 8 = 6 points for midterm 1 (0.75 was higher, so the final
  increased the midterm score!)
- MAX(1, 0.25) * 8 = 8 points for midterm 2 (0.25 was lower, so the original
  midterm score was used)
- 0.75 * 8 + 0.25 * 8 + 1 * 0.8 = 16 points for the final exam (the score on
  the final exam is the same regardless of how the midterms went)
- A total of 30 out of 40 exam points towards your final grade

This policy also covers what happens if you miss a midterm for any reason. If
you are absent for a midterm, you get a 0 initially, and then whatever score
you get on the final for that section will be applied to your midterm grade.
There are no make-up midterms, and the final exam policy is governed by the
[university's
policies](https://senate.ucsd.edu/operating-procedures/educational-policies/courses/epc-policies-on-courses/policy-exams-including-midterms-final-exams-and-religious-accommodations-for-exams/).

<h3 id="lab">Labs</h3>

Along with the course, you are enrolled in a lab section, which meets each
Tuesday.
